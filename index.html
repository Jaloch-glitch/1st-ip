        <div class="column"><h3>Final Remarks</h3>
        	<p>The ancient Greek philosopher Thales said, “The most difficult thing in life is to know yourself.”Luckily being a philosophy enthusiast myself, I know about me. I am an energetic young man who takes great pride in helping people and making notable contributions to society. My vision is to impact every person who I come across in this challanging journey called life. My mantra in life is, <strong>BE THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO SEE.</strong> I believe that most of the problems we have in life is because most people's philosophy of life is, <em>window pespective, blaming people for bad things and mirror pespective- taking all the credit for the good things</em> I believe thatif everyone can take responsibility for both the good and the bad, the wold will be a better place.</em></p>
